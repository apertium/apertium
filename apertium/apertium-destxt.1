.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR apertium-destxt 
is an text format processor. Data should be passed through this 
processor before being piped to lt-proc. The program takes input
in the form of a text file and produces output suitable for
processing with lt-proc. Format information (newlines, tabs, etc.) is enclosed in brackets so that lt-proc treats it as whitespace between words.
