.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR apertium-desrtf 
is an RTF format processor. Data should be passed through this 
processor before being piped to lt-proc. The program takes input
in the form of an RTF document and produces output suitable for 
processing with lt-proc. RTF commands  and other format information are  enclosed in brackets so that lt-proc treats them as whitespace between words.
