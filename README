# Apertium

Apertium is a rule-based machine translation toolchain and ecosystem, designed to facilitate the creation of machine translation systems. Many of our tools are based on finite-state transducers, enabling the processing of natural languages with high efficiency and accuracy.

## Project Overview

Apertium provides an open-source framework for building machine translation systems. Our primary focus is on creating deterministic, rule-based translation models that are both language-agnostic and platform-independent. Unlike statistical or neural translation models, Apertium's systems are entirely based on linguistic rules, ensuring that translations are consistent and easy to understand.

Our language data is stored in a variety of formats, including XML and other human-editable text files. This data is organized into single-language packages, which handle the analysis and generation of individual languages, and translation pairs, which manage the transfer and transformation of data between languages. Single-language packages are shared among many translation pairs, enabling modularity and reuse.

## Features

- *Rule-Based Translation:* Apertium relies on deterministic rules, providing consistent and transparent translations.
- *Finite-State Transducers:* Many tools are built using finite-state transducers, offering efficient language processing.
- *Language-Agnostic Tools:* Core tools are designed to work across multiple languages, enabling broad applicability.
- *Modular Design:* Language data is organized into reusable packages, simplifying the development of new translation pairs.

## Installation
