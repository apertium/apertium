# Apertium

Apertium is an open-source rule-based machine translation toolchain and ecosystem. It facilitates the creation of consistent and transparent machine translation systems by relying on deterministic linguistic rules rather than statistical or neural models. Apertium's tools are designed to be language-agnostic and platform-independent, making them suitable for a wide range of languages and applications.

## Project Overview

Apertium's framework is based on finite-state transducers, which enable efficient and accurate processing of natural languages. The language data used by Apertium is stored in XML and other human-readable text formats, organized into modular single-language packages and translation pairs. This modularity allows for the reuse of language data across multiple translation systems.

## Features

- **Rule-Based Translation:** Consistent and understandable translations based on deterministic rules.
- **Finite-State Transducers:** Efficient language processing using advanced computational models.
- **Language-Agnostic Tools:** Broad applicability across multiple languages.
- **Modular Design:** Reusable language packages simplify the development of new translation pairs.

## Requirements

To build and run Apertium, ensure that the following dependencies are installed:

- **lttoolbox 3.5** (required): Available at [lttoolbox GitHub repository][1].
- **libxml2**
- **libpcre**

For detailed installation instructions, visit [Apertium](https://apertium.org) and the [Apertium Wiki](https://wiki.apertium.org).

## Installation

Apertium provides binaries for several platforms, including Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, CentOS, OpenSUSE, Windows, and macOS. Both nightly builds and official releases are available. If you are on a supported platform, it is recommended to use the pre-built binaries.

For more information, see the [Apertium Installation Guide](https://wiki.apertium.org/wiki/Installation).

### Building from Source

If you need to modify Apertiumâ€™s behavior or are on a platform that is not officially supported, follow these steps to build from source:

1. **Download the Source Packages:**

    Download `lttoolbox-VERSION.tar.gz`, `apertium-VERSION.tar.gz`, and the relevant linguistic data packages.

2. **Build lttoolbox:**

    ```bash
    cd lttoolbox-VERSION
    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install
    ```

3. **Build Apertium:**

    ```bash
    cd apertium-VERSION
    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install
    ```

4. **Set Up Linguistic Data:**

    ```bash
    cd LING_DATA_DIR
    ./configure
    make
    ```

    This step may take a few minutes.

5. **Verify the Installation:**

    Run the following command to check if Apertium is installed correctly:

    ```bash
    apertium -h
    ```

    You should see the Apertium help message.

## Usage

Apertium can be used to translate text between supported languages. The following example demonstrates how to translate a text file from Spanish to Catalan:

```bash
apertium -f txt es-ca <input.txt >output.txt

### Command Options

*   \-d datadir: Specifies the directory containing linguistic data.
    
*   \-f format: Specifies the input format (e.g., txt, html, rtf).
    
*   \-a: Displays ambiguity in the translation.
    
*   \-u: Suppresses marks for unknown words.
    
*   \-n: Prevents insertion of a period before potential sentence ends.
    
*   \-m memory.tmx: Uses a translation memory to improve translation accuracy.
    
*   \-o direction: Specifies the translation direction using the translation memory.
    
*   \-l: Lists available translation directions.
    

Additional Tools
----------------

Apertium includes various deformatters and reformatters for processing different document formats:

*   **Deformatters:** apertium-deshtml, apertium-desrtf, apertium-destxt
    
*   **Reformatters:** apertium-rehtml, apertium-rertf, apertium-retxt
